I always hear about my friend's plaining, they say their ine is such low that they can't not make ends meet. At first, I would pity for them, but in the long run, I find their work is so easy, they just sit in the office from 9 am to 5 pm, they even don't need to go out for business. While I see another friend, he works so hard, his working hour is very unstable, sometimes he even works until 9 pm. The fact is that he earns the most between my friends. It is true that no pain, no gain, if people want more, they need to pay out more. Comparing to be envy about other people's great ine, we'd better to work hard to realize what we want. There is not short-cut for people to get successful, working hard is the only way.
